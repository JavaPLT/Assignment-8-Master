This assignment is a reprise of Assignment 5 in Racket.  It demonstrates how functional programs can be written (with a bit of extra effort) in Java rather than a genuine functional language like Racket (Scheme).
The details of the assignment are given in the PDF file [`HW08.pdf`](https://github.com/JavaPLT/Assignment-8-Master/blob/main/HW08.pdf).
